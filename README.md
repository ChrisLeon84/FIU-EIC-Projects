# FIU-EIC-Projects
The folder contains projects done for the FIU EIC group. 

The group's goal is to form a physics simulator specifically designed for the EIC collider using Monte Carlo techniques. This includes exercises meant for newcomers, but will also potentially include code that will go into the simulator.
